TODO List for the grid cellular automaton project

DONE symbol = #


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


24/06/2023 : The writePopulationtoFile() function appends the total populations in reverse order, i.e. latest update is written at the top of the file.
      - Reverse the order of appending. (25/06/2023)#
      
24/06/2023 : The different update functions were not immplementing the Neumann neighborhood correctly.
      - Sample all units for every combinations
      for the ranges (i-1, i+1) and (j-1, j+1). (25/06/2023) #

26/06/2023 : The systematic measurement of variance for different window sizes does not function correctly for now.
      - Debug the counting within the windows and 
      the measurement of the variance with a calculator. (26/06/2023) #

28/06/2023 : Prey units on the border of the grid, i = 0 or j = 0, seem to not be updated.
	- Find the origin of this bug. (01/07/2023) #

01/07/2023 : Create a file to enable the exploration of the parameter space, i.e. multiple parameters with a range of value.
	- the wrapper.c functions for integer parameter values (04/07/2023) #

04/07/2023 : Enable support for parameter with floating values on the wrapper.
	- Pretty simple fix after all. (12/07/2023) #
	
04/07/2023 : Create functions to enable new types of initial conditions. With different proportion of initial numbers of prey and predator and different spatial configurations.
	- The generateGridRandom() function has been updated to allow for two parameters AGENTSDENSITY and PREYRATIO controlling, respectively, the proportion of occupied cells on the lattice, and the predator/prey ratio among these occupied cells. (12/07/2023) #

13/07/2023 : Write a function in analysis.h to compute the temporal autocorrelation for a population dynamics time series. Combined with different window sizes, it should permit to see the increase in determinism or the decrease in chaos towards higher window sizes.
        - The prototype autocorrPrototyp.c performs all the above correctly, and the code to produce a graphical display is already developed. (23/09/2023) #


	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


23/09/2023 : Integrate the autocorrPrototype.c file as a method of the analysis.h header file to be used and tuned on from the parameters.h file.
        - Almost done, need to enable the tuning from the parameters.h file, which is not functional for now. (26/02/2024) #
	
26/02/2024 : Enable the autocorrelation measure for different window sizes.
	- 
        
17/09/2023 : Develop a functionality to save results of one or multiple similar simulations in a seperate, newly created folder.
	- 

12/07/2023 : Once the cellular automaton's parameter space is ready to be explored, integrate the existing wrapper prototype to be used in the main program.
